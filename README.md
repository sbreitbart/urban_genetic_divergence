## Abstract


## Using this code

### R script key

* `functions.R`: Contains functions used in analyses.
* `libraries.R`: Contains libraries used in analyses.

### Folder key

* `data`: Contains data collected during 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 field seasons.
* `Figures_Tables`: Contains figures and tables summarizing analyses.
* `misc`: Contains miscellaneous files associated with project.
* `renv`: Contains archived versions of packages used in analyses.
* `scripts`: Contains scripts used to clean data, generate haversine distances, and perform analyses.

### Notes

* While analyzing the data, we had two questions guiding our analysis: Q1 and Q2. After drafting the paper, we created 3 questions instead (Q1, Q2, Q3). The Q1 and Q2 in this code refer to what is now Q2 and Q3 in the manuscript, respectively. The Q1 referred to in the manuscript was never given an official name.
