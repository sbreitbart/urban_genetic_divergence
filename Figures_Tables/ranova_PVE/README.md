# Subdirectory: ranova_PVE

## Folder description

### Defense, Growth and Reproduction (each separate folders)

These folders contains the trait-specific output ranova tables. Each document summarizes how much genetic variance exists within populations, how much genetic divergence exists among populations, how much of that variance is associated with urbanization (as distance from the urban center and urbanization score), and how much of that variance is associated with proxmity to a green corridor (these files contain "transects" in the filename).

The "nsim_10" and "nsim_1000" subdirectories contain this information when the number of simulations used for the non-Gaussian models was 10 and 1000, respectively. As the 1000-simulation analysis took much longer to run than the 10-simulation analysis, we ran 10 1000-simulations models, saw that the results were qualitatively identical to the 10-simulation models, and then ran the remaining models with n = 10 simulations.

The "PVE_nonGaussmods" contains the estimates of percent variance explained for the non-Gaussian models.

## File description

### ranovas_allyears_Table1.csv

This file contains a summary table of data extracted from trait-specific ranova tables in the Defense, Growth, and Reproduction folders. The data in this table was generated to answer how much genetic variance exists within populations and how much genetic divergence exists among populations.

### ranovas_allyears_Table2.csv

This file contains a summary table of data extracted from trait-specific ranova tables in the Defense, Growth, and Reproduction folders. The data in this table was generated to answer how much of the previously-estimated genetic variance is associated with urbanization (as distance from the urban center and urbanization score).

### ranovas_allyears_transects_Table1.csv

This file contains a summary table of data extracted from trait-specific ranova tables in the Defense, Growth, and Reproduction folders. The data in this table was generated to answer how much of the previously-estimated genetic variance is associated with proxmity to a green corridor.

### ranovas_allyears_Table1_reproducible.docx, ranovas_allyears_Table2_reproducible.docx, ranovas_allyears_transects_Table1_reproducible.docx

These docx files contain the publication-quality tables of the data in the synonymous csv files (noted above).
