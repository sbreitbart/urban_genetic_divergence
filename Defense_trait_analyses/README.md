# Subdirectory: Defense_trait_analyses

## Folder description

### Figures

This folder contains figures of regressions and ANOVA tables for defense traits.

### images

This folder contains 3 herbivore images used in regressions of herbivore abundance predicted by urbanization.

### Tables

This folder contains tables of ranova results for defense traits.

## File description

### Analysis_ Rmds

- Analysis_defense.Rmd and
- Analysis_herbivores_2021.Rmd

contain scripts used to analyze models generated in

- Model_diagnostics_Defense.Rmd and
- Model_diagnostics_herbivores.Rmd.

Analysis_cardenolides.Rmd and Analysis_herbivores_2020.Rmd do not import models from different Rmds and instead contain that code.

### Figures_ Rmds

Similarly, files beginning with Figures_ contain scripts used to create figures from similarly-named Rmds.

### Model_diagnostics_ Rmds

Similarly, files beginning with Model_diagnostics_ contain scripts used to fit models with defense trait data.

### mvabund_herbivore.Rmd

This rmd contains a script used to test whether the overall herbivore community changes with urbanization using `mvabund`.
