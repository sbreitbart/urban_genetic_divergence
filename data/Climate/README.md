This csv contains climate data (daily temperatures, precipitation, etc.) from 1/1/2014 to 12/31/2018 for Oakville Twn and Toronto City weather stations for the purpose of highlighting temperature-related differences at each end of the urban-rural gradient. The Oakville Twn station was chosen to represent the rural end of the gradient because there were no other eastern stations with the required data.
